Emms cover shows the cover of the currently playing album in EMMS. <br/>
MView Image is a simplistic image viewer, based on ImageMagick that shows an image scaled to fit and centered, from which EMMS cover is derived. It is mostly of interest to elisp programmers.

<h3>EMMS cover installation and usage</h3>
Add (require 'emms-cover) somewhere in your .emacs. Then do M-x emms-cover-show.
